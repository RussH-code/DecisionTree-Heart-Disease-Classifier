# Decision Tree - Heart Disease Classifier

Heart disease occurs when the heart's blood supply is blocked by a build-up of plague (fatty substances) in the coronary arteries. It is a leading cause of death worldwide. It is also a treatable and preventable disease, given the appropriate medication and life style changes. Therefore, prediction of heart disease is of great social value and can facilitate early treatment of patients.
